* This framework can be used a base framework for any API Automation Project.
* I have implemented below libraries:
     * Cucumber: For Test Scenario Creation
     * Rest Assured: For hitting and validating the api responses
     * Extent Report GrassHopper Cucumber Adpater: For non-intrusive Extent Reporting. Check the ref here: https://grasshopper.tech/2098/
     * Google Guava Library: For Preconditions and other useful classes and methods which Guava lib provides like Pre-conditions checkNull / CheckArguments etc
     * Google Guice Library: For Dependency Injection of Test Context object so that ReqSpec and Response object can be shared across multiple Step Defs.
     * Builder Design Pattern/ObjetMapper Class: For Mapping Request and Response JSON with POJO.
